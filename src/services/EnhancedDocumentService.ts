NATIONAL PARIVAR MEDICLAIM PLUS POLICY

Section 1: Grace Period for Premium Payment
A grace period of thirty (30) days is provided for premium payment after the due date. During this period, the policy remains in force and all benefits continue to be available. If premium is not paid within the grace period, the policy will lapse and coverage will terminate.

Section 2: Waiting Periods for Pre-existing Diseases
There is a waiting period of thirty-six (36) months of continuous coverage from the first policy inception for pre-existing diseases and their direct complications to be covered. This waiting period ensures policy sustainability and prevents adverse selection.

Section 3: Maternity Benefits Coverage
The policy covers maternity expenses including childbirth and lawful medical termination of pregnancy. To be eligible for maternity benefits, the female insured person must have been continuously covered for at least 24 months. Coverage is limited to two deliveries or terminations during the policy period.

Section 4: Room Rent and ICU Sub-limits
For Plan A, the daily room rent is capped at 1% of the Sum Insured, and ICU charges are capped at 2% of the Sum Insured. These limits do not apply if treatment is taken in a Preferred Provider Network (PPN). Semi-private room accommodation is covered without sub-limits.

Section 5: No Claim Discount Benefits
A No Claim Discount of 5% on the base premium is offered on renewal for a one-year policy term if no claims were made in the preceding year. The maximum aggregate NCD is capped at 5% of the total base premium.

Section 6: AYUSH Treatment Coverage
The policy covers medical expenses for inpatient treatment under Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy systems. Treatment must be taken in a recognized AYUSH hospital and is covered up to the Sum Insured limit.
